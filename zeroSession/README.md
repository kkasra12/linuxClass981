#### bash
The GNU Bourne Again Shell (bash) is based on the earlier Bourne shell for Unix but extends it in several ways. In Linux, bash is the most common default shell for user accounts, and it’s the one emphasized in this book and on the exam.
#### tcsh  
This shell is based on the earlier C shell (csh). It’s a fairly popular shell in some circles, but no major Linux distributions make it the default shell. Although it’s similar to bash in many respects, some operational details differ. For instance, you don’t assign environment variables the same way in
tcsh as in bash.
#### csh  
The original C shell isn’t used much on Linux, but if a user is familiar with
csh, tcsh makes a good substitute.
#### ksh  
The Korn shell (ksh) was designed to take the best features of the Bourne shell and the C shell and extend them. It has a small but dedicated following among Linux users.
#### zsh  
The Z shell (zsh) takes shell evolution further than the Korn shell, incorporating features from earlier shells and adding still more.
